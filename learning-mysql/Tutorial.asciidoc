# Tutorial

## Connecting to and Disconnecting from the server

```
shell> mysql -h host -u user -p
Enter password: ********
```

Disconnect:

```
mysql> QUIT
Bye
```

On Unix, you can also disconnect by pressing control+D.

## Entering Queries

- 大小写不敏感
- 支持单选多个语句（分号分割）

    mysql> SELECT VERSION(); SELECT NOW();

- 支持多行语句，直到分号处才执行
- 取消执行已输入的语句用``\c``

    mysql> SELECT
    -> USER()
    -> \c
    mysql>
